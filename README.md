### The Design Philosophy
In Minecraft, minecarts run 45 degrees straight on continuous curved rails. However, the vanilla texture produces a twisty pattern for the continuous curved rails. This pack fixed that by making the curved rails diagonal-perfect. Now the rails fit the motion of minecarts!

The vanilla models of the ramp rails look fragile since they lack support. This pack fixed that by adding wooden frames under the ramp rails.

3D models look nice.
